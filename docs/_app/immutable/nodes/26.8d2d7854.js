    UIDs are just sequential numbers and can be used for anything you like, not
    just entities. As opposed to a GUID, which is a unique ID for all entities,
    a UID is only unique for its own sequence. Therefore, they are more visually
    appealing to be used as an ID. (Think Sale #615 vs Sale

Then a malicious
    user can mess with the UID. Instead, from the server side, you can create a
    UID when the entity is saved. You can also gate UIDs using abilities like
    &quot;uid/get/nameofuid&quot;, &quot;uid/new/nameofuid&quot;, and &quot;uid/set/nameofuid&quot;. These
    abilities are <strong>only</strong> checked for client queries. If you&#39;re
    using UIDs from Node.js and want to gate them, use the
    <code>checkClientUIDPermissions</code> method on Tilmeld.`,L,D,z=`Caution: If a UID is incremented, and the entity you're using it on can't be
